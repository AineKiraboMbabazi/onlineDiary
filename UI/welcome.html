                            <p> Mydiary is a place where you record events, experiences and other personal things that interest you. You can write about whatever you like, free of outside judgment or criticism. It should be an extension of your mind: safe and free. A diary can be whatever you decide and should be a place where you can be honest. </p>
							<p> Dairies can be therapeutic, productive and creative. If you have ever wanted a place to vent, reflect and grow, a diary is that place.</p>
							<p>When talking to people, sometimes we feel as though we cannot be 100% honest. We worry about what people think, how they will react and feel. We worry about how people will perceive us after we share our thoughts and feelings with them. With a diary, you donot have to worry about anyone but yourself. Be as honest as you can possibly be. Your diary is for your eyes only. </p>
